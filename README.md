# Runner agent using Reinforcement Learning

**Pitfall Skipper** is a Machine Learning Agent which uses a variant of Reinforcement Learning called [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm introduced by Open AI](https://blog.openai.com/openai-baselines-ppo/) to build an agent which learns to survive a sequence of platforms by jumping from one platform to another by avoiding falling into the killzones.

This project uses the implementation of PPO in Unity Environment created by Unity at [this repo](https://github.com/unity-technologies/ml-agents). This project was built on top of the provided implementation to PPO and tailored for the provided state and action space.
